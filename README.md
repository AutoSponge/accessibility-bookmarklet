# A11Y Bookmarklets

These [bookmarklets/favelets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) are designed for evaluating web accessibility, but are not necessarily tools for web developers. The primary purpose of these bookmarklets is to facilitate data collection of a site's accessibility alongside supporting some basic human verification. The generated CSV data can then be uploaded into a database for larger scale analyses.

In particular, these tools are an integral part to a large-scale Library Accessible E-Resources study (link forthcoming).

## External Resources

The bookmarklets utilize the following external JavaScript libraries. Copies of these are kept in the `externals/` directory to allow for local usage and to create a single point for downloads.
